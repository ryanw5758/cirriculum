This program is a C++ implementation of the producer consumer problem, where producer and consumer threads run concurrently and write to and read from a buffer respectively.

The program can be compiled by typing the command:
    make OS_Proj2

in the command line. Three other additional arguments are taken, and these arguments are the buffer space, number of producers, and number of consumers respectively.
