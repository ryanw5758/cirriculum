This file package consists of a C++ program to simulate different scheduling algorithms for processes. Five algorithms are simulated: First Come First Serve,
Shortest Job First, Shortest Time To Completion First, Round Robin, and Priority.

A sample test input and output file are also provided. Once making the system by typing "make project3" in the Linux terminal, the program can be run by providing
an input file as the second command line input, the output file as the third, and the simulated clock cycle as the third.
